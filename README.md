# voltage-tester-of-battery-using-arduino
Arduino can be used to make a device capable of measuring the voltage of a given battery. Arduino Uno measures voltage difference, so two of the Analog input pins are  to be used. It can measure a maximum of 5 volt and since one unit of measurement is equivalent to 5/1024 so voltage difference will be reading*5/1024. So we can know the voltage  of the battery if the voltage is less than 5 volts. For measuring voltages of batteries above 5 volts, resistors may be used.     Increasing the range of voltage tester:  For this purpose, resistors of high resistance(each of same resistance) may be used.  Resistances should be high enough to ensure that current through the circuits is in mill amperes.  Resistances should be equal so as to increase the accuracy of the result.
